# 📄 Assignment: Registration Form UI

## ✨ Overview
This project is a **responsive frontend-only** registration form developed as part of a company assignment.  
It focuses purely on **UI/UX** and **basic form components** without any backend integration or form validation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React.js** (Functional Components, Hooks)
- **TailwindCSS** (for rapid, clean UI design)

---

## 📋 Features

- **Responsive design** - looks good on mobile and desktop.
- **Interactive radio buttons** to select "Are you an Agency?".
- **Create Account** button styled with hover effects.
- **Focus states** on inputs with purple ring highlighting.

## 💽 Pages
- `/register` ➔ User can fill details like:
  - Full Name
  - Phone Number
  - Email Address
  - Password
